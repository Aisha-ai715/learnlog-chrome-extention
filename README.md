# Learning Tracker – Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps me save learning resources I want to come back to later, such as documentation, tutorials, and videos.

I built this project while learning JavaScript through the **Scrimba – Learn JavaScript** course, using only core web technologies.

## What it does
- Save the current tab as To Learn
- Add a short note explaining why the link was saved
- Mark resources as Done or Not Done
- Store all data using localStorage

## Built with
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript
